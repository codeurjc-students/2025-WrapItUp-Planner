# WrapItUp Planner

WrapItUp Planner is an All-In-One collaborative web platform designed to help students manage their academic journey more efficiently. The application combines study organization, knowledge sharing, and AI-powered tools into a single platform. Students can create and share notes, collaborate through comments, and organize their academic life effectively.

## Version 0.1

Version 0.1 of WrapItUp Planner focuses on the note-taking and summary aspects of the application. Users can now create their own accounts, log in, and edit their profiles. The platform enables users to create, edit, delete, and view notes, which can be set as either public or private. Private note owners can share their content with specific users, allowing them to view and comment. Administrator functionality includes access to all notes and the ability to delete notes and comments when necessary. Users have a dedicated notes page where they can browse their content organized by categories and view notes that have been shared with them.
